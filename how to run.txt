1) I navigated into my project folder
and created a virtual environment with anaconda
(N.B. we need python 3.6 to 3.8 for PyCaret to work correctly)

conda create --name diamond python=3.8 ipython

Make sure to check that the python version is 3.8


2) Then I activated the env

conda activate diamond


3) Then I installed the following packages

pip install pycaret
python -m ipykernel install --user --name diamond --display-name "diamond"
pip install fastapi
pip install uvicorn[standard]
(or pip install "uvicorn[standard]")
pip install gradio


4) I then created the requirements.txt file

pip freeze > requirements.txt

You can install the same packages with

pip install -r requirements.txt 


5) It is possible to run the app with the following command:

uvicorn diamond:app

The http://127.0.0.1:8000/ address will automatically redirect to
http://127.0.0.1:8000/diamond where the interface is displayed
